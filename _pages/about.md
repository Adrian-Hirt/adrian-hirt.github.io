I am a software engineer with a strong background in computer science, holding an MSc ETH in Computer Science from [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html){:target="_blank"}. My academic focus was on data management systems and computer graphics, with a deep personal interest in mixed reality. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer at [GetYourGuide](https://getyourguide.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Beyond my professional work, I am committed to continuous learning and enjoy exploring emerging technologies, particularly in XR and computer vision. Throughout my studies and personal projects, I have worked extensively in AR/VR, gaining hands-on experience through research and development.

Outside of technology, I enjoy cycling, hiking and cosplaying.
