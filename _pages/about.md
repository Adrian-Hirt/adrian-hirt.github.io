Hello, and welcome on my Website.

I've been very interested in computers for a long time, and as such I turned my passion into my profession and studied computer science at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html){:target="_blank"}, from where I graduated with a MSc ETH in CS in 2023.

For more informations about my studies, please visit the [Studies Page]({% link _pages/studies.md %}).

Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Sitrox](https://www.sitrox.com/web/de/){:target="_blank"}.

Before I joined ETH Zürich, I attended the [Gymnasium Neufeld](https://gymneufeld.ch/){:target="_blank"} in Bern, with a focus on Biology & Chemistry and a minor in History. After that, I completed my mandatory army service at the Airforce base in Payerne, where I got promoted to Private First Class for good performance.

In my free time, I enjoy riding my bikes, cosplaying or DJing. Check out [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@djaccelerate7644) for some mixes!
