## L4N

L4N is a CMS for LAN parties. It's the successor of the old CMS I build for the
[VSETH GECo](https://geco.ethz.ch/), with a focus on flexibility, such that it can also be used
for other LAN parties or even other events. It's released under the AGPL-3.0 license, and as such
you can use it for your LAN party or project. You can find the code, installation guide and more
on the [L4N github repo](https://github.com/Adrian-Hirt/l4n).

## XRe

XRe is a small XR engine I develop, using OpenXR and DirectX 11, to get some experience
with XR development, try out some ideas and just have fun programming. You can find the code
on the [XRe github repo](https://github.com/Adrian-Hirt/XRe).
